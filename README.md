# Scripts to build NAS server

## Usage

Run the "start.sh" script on a fresh Debian installation to setup a N.A.S. where storage is located in a directory named "Public" that is on the root of a separate drive or partition. A lite version of the server will be automatically installed on devices having less than 1GB of R.A.M.

```shell
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ctonton/homeserver/main/start.sh -O start.sh && chmod +x start.sh && bash start.sh
```
